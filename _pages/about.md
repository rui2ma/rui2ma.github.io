Hello there! I am a second year master's student in [The GRASP Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at [The University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/). Previously, I received my dual B.S. in Computer Engineering and Mathematics from [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/).

My research interests focus on the planning and decision-making process of multi-agent systems. I am currently writing my master's thesis on multi-robot coverage in unknown environment with sparse signal density.
