        In this collaboration research with <a href="https://alelab.seas.upenn.edu/">Alelab</a>, we seek to use a learning-based approach to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem">vehicle routing problem</a>. We proposed a layered graph neural network (GNN) architecture consisting of a perception GNN (pGNN) that predicts individual optimal routes, and a communication GNN (cGNN) that coordinates routes between agents. In this work, I utilized expert solutions produced by Googleâ€™s ORTools to train the pGNN with imitation learning.
