In Borg Lab at Georgia Institute of Technology, we envision to make robotic arm paint like [Sandro Botticelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli)!

        Admittedly, it is a grand vision, but we made incremental progress towards it! During my time there, we achieved simple geometric shapes and stick figures paintings. My work in this project included integrating computer vision techniques to the motion planning pipeline to enable more complex paintings. Additionally, I programmed the automated painting data collection process to help build a paint brush model for more refined paintings.
